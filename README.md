## How to run the code

1. Start by installing the dependencies with:
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Then, you can run the code with:
   ```python main.py```

## How does it work?

[WIP] - We will add a description of the code here, when the paragraph on it will be finalized on the report.
